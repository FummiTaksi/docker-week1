Docker should be used, when development setups are wanted to be minimized on different machines where the project is developed. Docker makes it easy to configure certain images, where for example packages can be installed and all the procedures made to make the application run are in one place. Docker should be used on projects, which depend on many parts: With Docker, the initialization of project has to be done only once correctly manually, after that the outcome can be for example pulled from Docker Hub.  Without Docker, all the procedures have to be done manually every time, which requires a documentation on how the project can be run. With Docker, the amount of documentation is reduced since many steps are done automatically.  Benefits of Docker can also be noticed in development work: Docker makes it easy to glue all the application parts together, and makes it easy to stop, configure, kill or restart only certain parts of the application. Docker can be used to easen the configuration of testing setups. Docker enables the benefits of DockerHub and other artifactorys, where images can be uploaded. This makes the ordering of the versions easier. Images also makes it easier to upload only certain parts of application to your machine (instead of cloning the whole repository)
